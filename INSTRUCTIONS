 -------------- Description --------------

The NtuAnalysis package is based on the NtuTool package and contains several
functionalities specific for CMS analyses using (MINI)AOD as source and 
ntuples as output or intermediate data format. Most of these functionalities 
could be easily implemented by each analyst; they're provided in this package 
just to avoid the replication of solutions to common needs and, consequently,
a simplification of work and time sparing.

The main features of the NtuAnalysis package are:
- the possibility to build an analysis skeleton simply executing a command
  on a linux terminal;
- the encapsulation in dedicated classes of the following operations:
  - ntuple definition,
  - ntuple data filling from (MINI)AOD,
  - ntuple data analysis;
- the possibility to choose at runtime if, with the very same C++ code, 
  a "traditional" flat ntuple is to be produced, an EDM ntuple or a NANOAOD,
  in a fully transparent way;
- the possibility to analyze, with the very same C++ code, "traditional" flat
  ntuples, EDM ntuples or NANOAOD, specifying the format at runtime;
- the possibility to link ntuple production and analysis in a single run,
  choosing to write or skip any entry on the basis of an analysis on-the-fly,
  returning "true" or "false" from an "analyze(...)" function;
- the possibility to preselect ntuple entries at analysis time, to read only
  some branch to choose if reading the whole tree and analyze it or skip the
  entry without reading all the other branches;
- the automatic inclusion in ntuples of run, lumisection and event numbers,
  and the possibility to select or skip specific events simply giving a list.
All the functionalities available from NtuTool can be used, too.

The package is structured as a CMSSW subsystem, with 3 packages:
NtuAnalysis/Common : code to common to ntuple production and analysis;
NtuAnalysis/Write  : code to produce ntuples;
NtuAnalysis/Read   : code to analyze ntuples.

In principle the analyst does not need knowing the content of those packages,
because all the user code is to stay in a dedicated subsystem XYZAnalysis,
built with the "makeTemplate.sh" script mentioned above and having 
itself 2 packages:
XYZAnalysis/Ntu : ntuple definition and analysis, that can be exported
                  on any PC where C++ and ROOT are installed;
XYZAnalysis/EDM : code to get data from (MINI)AOD and fill ntuple.
The skeleton built with the "makeTemplate.sh" script contains some example
code that the user can easily modify and/or replicate.

A documentation page, in preparation, can be found on a dedicated TWiki:

 -------------- Recipe for the impatient user --------------

Look at steps 1, 2, 3, 7 to produce and analyze a flat ntuple; to analyze 
the same ntuple outside CMSSW look at steps 10 and 11. Look inside the files
listed in the "Customize ntuple content, production & analysis" to see how
to introduce your analysis material in the framework.
Look at steps 5, 8 (and 12 to do the analysis outside CMSSW) for EDM ntuples.
Look at steps 6, 9 (and 13 to do the analysis outside CMSSW) for NANOAOD.

 -------------- Download and create an analysis skeleton --------------

 ----- STEP 1 : download from git -----

cd ${CMSSW_BASE}/src
cmsenv
git clone https://github.com/ronchese/NtuTool
git clone https://github.com/ronchese/NtuAnalysis
scram b

# The package can be used across different CMSSW releases, running a script
# before compilation:

${CMSSW_BASE}/src/NtuAnalysis/uty/setAt764.sh #  CMSSW_7_6_4 and following
${CMSSW_BASE}/src/NtuAnalysis/uty/setAtA40.sh # CMSSW_10_4_0 and following
${CMSSW_BASE}/src/NtuAnalysis/uty/setAtA60.sh # CMSSW_10_6_0 and following

# The CMSSW versions listed above correspond to the ones used for testing, 
# their correctness cannot be guaranteed; e.g. a CMSSW_10_3_X could 
# require the script "setAtA40.sh".

# Refer to NtuTool instructions to handle different CMSSW versions for that
# package.

 ----- STEP 2 : build an analysis skeleton -----

# In the following, replace "xyz" with whatever you like, a subsystem
# named XYZAnalysis will be created.

cd ${CMSSW_BASE}/src
cmsenv
NtuAnalysis/uty/makeTemplate.sh xyz

 -------------- Customize ntuple content, production & analysis --------------

The ntuple content is defined in the classes XYZNtupleData
and XYZNtupleBranch ; the first contains only the variables and the
second contains the TBranch pointers and the code to bind them to the
persistent ntuple. In principle all that could stay in just one class,
it's splitted to add a flexibility that could be useful in some situations.

The example/skeleton deals with a ntuple having 2 blocks, each of them
has a boolean flag to allow switching it "on/off" to actually include
the corresponding data in the persistent ntuple, when writing the ntuple
itself, or actually read the corresponding branches when analyzing.

The user has to customize the following files, more detailed informations
and instructions are included through comments in each file:

- XYZAnalysis/Ntu/interface/XYZNtupleData.h
  contains the ntuple data (or pointers) declarations
- XYZAnalysis/Ntu/src/XYZNtupleData.cc
  contains the code to allocate dynamic variables, vectors or arrays
- XYZAnalysis/Ntu/interface/XYZNtupleBranch.h
  contains the ntuple TBranch pointers declarations
- XYZAnalysis/Ntu/interface/XYZNtupleBranch.hpp
  contains the calls to "setBranch(...)"

- XYZAnalysis/EDM/interface/PIPPOEDMToNtuple.h
  contains labels or input tokens, edm::Handles and so on,
  plus the "consume" instructions required by CMSSW and calls to other
  functions that, in their turn, call "setBranch(...)"; this code has to
  stay in the class interface (.h) because, to get the maximum flexibility,
  the constructor is templated.
- XYZAnalysis/EDM/src/PIPPOEDMToNtuple.cc
  parses the edm::ParameterSet, get data from (MINI)AOD and fill the
  ntuple structure

- XYZAnalysis/Ntu/bin/XYZAnalyzer.h
  contains the histogram object pointers declarations as well as any other
  member variable the user may need, plus the declaration of the functions
  for the ntuple analysis steps (see NtuTool/INSTRUCTIONS)
- XYZAnalysis/Ntu/bin/XYZAnalyzer.cc
  contains the implementation of the ntuple analysis functions, i.e.
  preliminary operations, histogram creation, actual analysis for each
  ntuple entry, conclusive operations and saving.
- XYZAnalysis/Ntu/bin/XYZAnalyzerUtil.(h|cc)
  contains code that in principle could stay in XYZAnalyzer.(h|cc) but is
  encapsulated in a separate class to allow sharing it among different
  analyses related among them and sharing common operations, e.g. any
  code to navigate through cross referenced indices or compute quantities
  depending on others but not stored themselves in the ntuple.

In the template skeleton two operations are encapsulated in XYZAnalyzerUtil:
- the choice of the ntuple blocks to activate, so that some blocks can be
  skipped when ntuple is produced, reducing space usage, or analyzed,
  reducing reading time;
- a simple ntuple entry preselection (see above).

 -------------- Examples --------------

In the following some simple examples are shown, making use of the
template skeleton; ntuples are written and read back in 3 formats:
- "traditional" flat ntuples,
- EDM ntuples,
- NANOAOD .
In the examples two blocks are included, one for muons and one for jets;
the muons block can be filled with random numbers to allow running the
example without the need of any (MINI)AOD file.
In the examples the following options are also implemented:
- events pre-filter with a run-event list, i.e. only selected events
  are received by the CMSSW module filling the ntuple data;
- independently on that, a run-event list can be queried by the CMSSW module
  filling the ntuple data, to process only listed events (or skip them);
- ntuple entries can be made persistent, i.e. actually written to the
  output, on the basis of an analysis on-the-fly
- use the output of that analysis on-the-fly to filter events before
  passing them to the following CMSSW module, if any.

Due to intrinsic difference in the way EDM ntuples and NANOAOD are produced,
there's some small difference in the way events are selected, processed and 
filtered:

- "traditional" flat ntuple production in an edm::EDAnalyzer or edm::EDFilter:
  - pre-filter by run-event list                               = YES
  - process or skip in the EDAnalyzer by run-event list        = YES
  - ntuple entry writing based on analysis on-the-fly          = YES
  - filter events before passing them to the following module  = YES
  for skipped events no output is written, event filtering before the
  following module is obtained using "XYZFilter" in place of "XYZNtuplizer"

- EDM ntuple production:
  - pre-filter by run-event list                               = YES
  - process or skip in the EDAnalyzer by run-event list        = YES
  - ntuple entry writing based on analysis on-the-fly          = YES
  - filter events before passing them to the following module  = YES
  for skipped events the event is written without the ntuple content,
  event filtering before the following module is obtained adding a dedicated
  filter in the "cms.Path"

- NANOAOD production:
  - pre-filter by run-event list                               = NO
  - process or skip in the EDAnalyzer by run-event list        = YES
  - ntuple entry writing based on analysis on-the-fly          = NO
  - filter events before passing them to the following module  = YES
  apparently NANOAOD production requires filling and writing all the events,
  so once the event has been processed the data structure is anyway written
